# Lone Commando
Simple C# Top-Down Shooter

This was a pretty simple Top-Down Shooter game I made in high school using C# and Microsoft XNA Framework.

You are a lone soldier in the woods battling off an onslaught of enemy soldiers, wolves, and tanks. You have a machinegun, grenades, and powerups that spawn randomly at your disposal.
