Simple C# Top-Down Shooter

This was a pretty simple Top-Down Shooter game I made using C# and Microsoft XNA Framework. You are a lone soldier in the woods battling off an onslaught of enemy soldiers, wolves, and tanks. You have a machinegun, grenades, and powerups that spawn randomly at your disposal. The game was made in VS 2010, so there may (probably) be some compatibility issues with newer software.
